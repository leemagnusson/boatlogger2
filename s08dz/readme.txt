Codewarrior version 10 project for s08dz microcontroller to 
be used as main logger with serial and can interface.

To open this in codewarrior, I found the easiest way was to 
make a new workspace and then drag and drop the .project 
file into the codewarrior projects pane. The debug 
configurations seem to not be automatically imported. You 
have to go to Project_Settings/test_MC* and then right 
click and go to debug as test_MC*.
